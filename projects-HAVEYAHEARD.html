                <p>for many fans, the excitement of a concert is often limited to the event itself, with no platform to extend the experience or discover new music related to artist. concert-goers miss opportunities to explore hidden gems and niche tracks that could enhance their appreciation for the artist.</p>

                <h4><b>dependence on partnerships</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>the app's integration with platforms like <b>ticketmaster</b> and <b>live nation</b> is essential for delivering personalized concert-related recommendations. however, if these partnerships can't be secured or maintained, it may limit the app's ability to enhance the concert experience as intended</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><b>niche audience appeal</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>while superfans are dedicated, they represent a smaller segment of the general music-listening audience. this could impact the app's ability to scale and attract a broad user base, limiting its reach and potential for growth</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><b>competition with mainstream streaming services</b></h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>major streaming platforms offer extensive music libraries and personalized playlists. competing with these well-established services for user attention may be challenging, especially if they already fulfill some of the app's niche discover features</li>

                <p>our initial idea was to create a prototype that worked alongside ticketing applications, like <b>ticketmaster.</b> this would allow users to immediately be able to connect with their favorite artists after buying tickets, and receive personalized recommendations for their favorite artists and genres. this was probably the easiest approach, but also an unrealistic approach because the app would be dependent on ticketing platforms.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>collaborating with artists to create exclusive content for superfans, such as personal playlists, commentary on rare tracks, or behind-the-scenes stories, could enhance the app's appeal</li>
                    <li>would provide superfans that unique insight into their favorite artists and deepen their connection</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><b>social features for fan communities</b></h4>        
                <ul>
                    <li>building out social features, such as fan forums and group playlists, could create a more interactive community</li>
                    <li>users could discuss their favorite hidden tracks, share rare finds, or even co-create playlists with friends or other superfans</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4><b>concert and event notifications</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>by collaborating with other ticketing agencies, users are able to get those personalized notifications about upcoming concerts, tailored to the user's favorite artists and genres</li>
